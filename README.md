# The Ultimate Python Guidebook
This repository contains samples
of code in .py files and in 
juptyer notebooks (.ipynb files).
Additionally, context is provided
in the code/notebooks. Much of the
code comes from *Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition* by Eric Matthes, No Starch Press (Read on the [OReilly Books Website](https://learning.oreilly.com)).

## Why this Guidebook?
After all, are the python docs and 
the plethora of books and tutorials
not enough? Well, they are enough. However, I am making this as a reference for myself and to help others learn how to program or learn Python. This is a non-commercial 
learning repo anyone can use.

## How to use this repo
